# Brain Tumor Classification

This project is a deep learning-based web application that classifies brain tumors from MRI images. Built with Python and HTML/CSS, it preprocesses datasets and uses a neural network to achieve high accuracy in detecting tumors.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`models_weights/`**: Contains the pre-trained model weights.
- **`src/`**: Source code for the web application, including the model and the interface.
- **`data/`**: Preprocessed MRI image datasets.
- **`templates/`**: HTML/CSS files for the web app interface.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For deep learning model.
- **OpenCV / PIL**: Image processing and augmentation.
- **Flask / Django** (depending on implementation): For the web server.
- **HTML / CSS**: User interface.
